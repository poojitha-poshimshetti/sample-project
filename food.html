            <td>burger is a dish consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. The patties are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon or chilis with condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns.</td>
           <td>Paneer or Cottage cheese is one of the most loved food items in Indian Cuisine. It is a vegetarian’s delight which is well loved at Parties and is a crowd favorite and owes its popularity to its pleasing texture and taste. It gently absorbs the flavors of the Curry or the gravy without being too Robust in itself.</td>
